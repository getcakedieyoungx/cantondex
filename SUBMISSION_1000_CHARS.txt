Track: AMM Swaps & DEXes

Title: CantonDEX - Privacy-Preserving Institutional DEX

Description: Privacy-preserving institutional DEX on Canton Network with atomic DvP settlement, 10 DAML smart contracts, Web3 wallet auth.

Problem: DEXes lack privacy (public order books), settlement risk (separate transfers), compliance (no KYC/AML), institutional features (margin, risk limits).

Solution: Canton sub-transaction privacy keeps orders confidential. Atomic DvP eliminates settlement risk. 10 type-safe DAML contracts: Account, Order, Trade, Settlement, Asset, Margin, Compliance, RiskLimit, CustodyBridge, AuditLog. MetaMask auth. 4 frontends (React, Vue, Next.js, Angular).

Tech: DAML 2.9.0, Canton Network, Python FastAPI, Web3.py, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka. 3.8K+ LOC.

Status: Working prototype with complete backend, 4 frontends, comprehensive docs.
